Thank you for your interest in studying with me! I am open to inquires from prospective applicants from a very wide range of backgrounds, including geoscience, environmental science, geography, archaeology, computer science, biology, chemistry, physics, math, etc. Candidates whose coursework and/or research or work experiences aligns with my projects and goals will be prioritized. Applications are welcome from candidates of any nationality.

I am particularly interested in students who would like to work on projects on the reconstruction of past human-environment interactions through the development and application of computer simulations. Topics include modeling ecosystem dynamics and biogeography, land use, Indigenous land management, wildfires, and Pleistocene megafauna popuations. The work will be mainly computer-based but could include visits to key field sites, or work as a field assistant on related projects. Previous experience in computer programming is not required but an interest in learning is essential.

M.Sc. students working with me will receive a minimum annual stipend of CAD $34,500 that may be augmented with scholarships, and will include additional support for travel, conferences, and other research expenses. Support is for a period of two years, contingent on satisfactory progress and funding.

**To apply**, familiarize yourself with my work and gather the following documents:

  * a one page statement of *how your research interests relate to my projects and publications*
  * a short CV that includes a list of your relevant research skills and background
  * scans of your university transcript(s)
  * scans of your IELTS (Academic) or TOEFL results, _if English is not your mother tongue_

**Submit an expression of interest [at this link](https://tally.so/r/eqDQ9E){:target="_blank"}.**

Review of applications will commence on **1 January 2026** and continue until positions are filled.

*Please note that due to the high number of applications received only shortlisted candidates will be contacted.*
