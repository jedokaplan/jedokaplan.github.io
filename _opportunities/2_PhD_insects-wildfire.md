## Ph.D. studentship in modeling boreal forest fire regime and ecosystem resilience under climate change in eastern Canada

### Position summary

The high latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere are among the fastest warming regions of the world. The boreal forests of eastern Canada are strongly affected by this climate change in part through changes in the dynamics of insect pathogens and wildfires. These dynamics are modified by poleward migration of forests, and forest management actions including fire suppression and timber harvest.

To better understand the broad scale effects of vegetation and fire dynamics, we aim to conduct simulation modelling of forest disturbance dynamics and to evaluate the efficacy of management actions in minimizing wildfire risk.

This project is funded through Natural Resources Canada's Wildfire Resilient Futures Initiative and led by the Ontario Forest Research Institute, part of the Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources. As part of this project, the Department of Earth, Energy, and Environment at the University of Calgary is seeking a motivated and skilled Ph.D. candidate to join our multidisciplinary research team ideally in the first half of 2026.

### Research Focus

The Ph.D. student will lead research on the development and application of a computer-based vegetation model to investigate vegetation-fire-insect interactions. The study domain covers the boreal forests of eastern Canada from the Atlantic Ocean to the Canadian Prairies. Tasks will include improvements to model capabilities, data assembly and management, experimental design, and analysis and visualization of model outputs. The work will be desk-based but may include trips to project field sites in the boreal forests of Ontario.

### Minimum qualifications

- Commitment to learning computer simulation and programming in a high-level language (R, Python, C++, Fortran, etc.).

- Strong quantitative and data analysis skills.

- Fluency in English listening, reading, and writing.

### Preferred qualifications

- A Master of Science in a STEM field or significant research experience leading to authorship on a publication.

- Coursework in ecology, climate science, global change biology, geography and related fields.

- Skills in scientific computer programming and GIS.

- Demonstrated experience of research work both independently and in a team.

### Location and start date

This position requires full-time, in-person presence at the University of Calgary main campus, in Calgary, Alberta, Canada. Secondments with project partners elsewhere in Canada may be part of the work.

The starting date for this position can be as early as 1 March 2026 and will be subject to arrangement with the selected candidate.

### Funding and support

This position includes a minimum annual stipend of CAD $34,500 that may be augmented with scholarships, and additional support for travel, conferences, and other research expenses. Support is for a period of 3 years, contingent on satisfactory progress and funding.

### <font color=red>How to apply</font>
