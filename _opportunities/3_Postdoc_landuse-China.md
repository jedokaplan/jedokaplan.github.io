### Position summary

The Hong Kong Research Grants Council supports the Area of Excellence project *Quantitative History of China: Historical Roots of Recent Success and Future Development*. In the framework of this five-year multidisciplinary project, I am searching for a postdoctoral fellow to lead a sub-project on aspects of the history of climate and society in China over the Holocene.

### Research Focus

The postdoctoral fellow will lead a project under the broad theme of understanding how prehistoric and historic land use change in China over the Holocene epoch (last 11,700 years) affected local, regional, and global environments. This work will follow on similar regional  projects undertaken for West Africa (Kay and Kaplan, 2015; Kay et al., 2019), Greece (Hughes et al., 2022), the Philippines (Findley et al., 2022; Findley et al., in prep), and other aspects of my past and ongoing research that focuses on Europe and North America. The postdoctoral fellow will be encouraged to develop their own research project within the overarching goals of the research program. Specific areas of focus could include paleoenvironmental reconstruction, land use mapping, economic history, human impacts on fire, air quality effects on human health, and related topics.
