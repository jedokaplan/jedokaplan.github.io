## Postdoctoral fellowship in the reconstruction of historical land use systems in China 

**Position summary**

The Hong Kong Research Grants Council supports the Area of Excellence project *Quantitative History of China: Historical Roots of Recent Success and Future Development*. In the framework of this five-year multidisciplinary project, I am searching for a postdoctoral fellow to lead a sub-project on reconstructing and mapping historical land use systems.

**Research Focus**

The postdoctoral fellow will lead a project to reconstruct and map land use systems in China over the Holocene epoch (last 11,700 years). This work will follow on similar projects undertaken for West Africa (Kay and Kaplan, 2015; Kay et al., 2019), Greece (Hughes et al., 2022), and the Philippines (Findley et al., 2022; Findley et al., in prep).
