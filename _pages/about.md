After many years in Europe and more recently in Hong Kong, I joined the Faculty of Science at the University of Calgary in 2023. I am currently the Canada Research Chair in Global System Modeling and full professor in the Departments of Earth, Energy, and Environment and Computer Science. My research primarily uses computer models and paleoenvironmental and archaeological data to study the interactions between land cover and climate, and the way in which climate change affects society and vice versa. I am particularly interested the interdisciplinary study of global environmental history from the Pleistocene to the Anthropocene.

Are you interested in understanding how climate and society changed in the past? Do you have a background in earth sciences, geography, archaeology, anthropology, or computer science? Would you like to work with computers, develop your own models and other computer programs? Can you assist with field-based experiential learning for undergraduates? I currently have **short-term research internships** and **full graduate scholarships** (research master's and Ph.D.) for outstanding candidates from anywhere in the world.
