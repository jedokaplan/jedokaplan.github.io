Are you interested in understanding how climate and society changed in the past? Do you have a background in environmental science, earth sciences, geography, archaeology, or anthropology, or related fields? Would you like to work with computers, develop your own models and other computer programs? I am currently offering **short-term paid research internships** (2-6 months), **full graduate scholarships** (research master's and Ph.D.), and **postdoctoral fellowships**. I welcome applications from prospective interns, graduate students, and postdocs of any gender, nationality, religion, and economic background.

Get in touch as early as possible: For Canadian applicants and permanent residents, note that NSERC funding applications for graduate scholarships have to be submitted in the autumn of the year before you plan to start your studies. For general information about applying for graduate studies, [click here](../grad-studies).

**For all positions, due to the high number of applications received only shortlisted candidates will be contacted.**
