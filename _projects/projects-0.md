In this project I am using the LPJ-LMfire dynamic vegetation model to simulate vegetation and fire in Western North America at 5km. Resolution. We are attempting to determine how much of recent wildfire activity is a product of the past 150 years of land use and wildfire management, including the suppression of Indigenous fire practices across much of The West.
