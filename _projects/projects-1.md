The BIOME1 global vegetation model and its follow-on versions BIOME3 and BIOME4 are among the most widely applied equilibrium global vegetation models. These models are still used for teaching and as a research tool for paleoclimate model analysis and biogeography among other fields. The models are around 30 years old however, and a modernization and revision of the code is a valuable objective. I am working with students to update these models to take advantage of modern computer processor power, coding languages, and better process understanding to create a lightweight, portable global equilibrium vegetation model for the 2020s.
