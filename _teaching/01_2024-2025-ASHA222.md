I am currently teaching a first-year undergraduate course on the theory of knowledge for the University of Calgary's [Arts and Science Honours Academy](https://arts.ucalgary.ca/future-students/undergraduate-experience/opportunities/join-arts-and-science-honours-academy){:target="_blank"}. This year-long course explores the way knowledge is created.
