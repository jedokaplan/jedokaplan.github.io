From 2014-2024 I was a teacher in the European Research Course on Atmospheres [(ERCA)](https://erca.sciencesconf.org){:target="_blank"}. I lectured on the role of the land surface in the climate system and the long-term history of human-environment interactions. I also supervised student projects and participated in the climate debate evening activity.
