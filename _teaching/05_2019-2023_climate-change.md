From 2020-2023 I taught taught an introductory course to the science of climate change in The University of Hong Kong's [Common Core](https://commoncore.hku.hk){:target="_blank"} program. As part of this course, all students completed the [Climate Fresk](https://climatefresk.org/world/){:target="_blank"}.
